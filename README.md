iBeacon
=======

iOS iBeacon Project in Swift Language

A simple project to create an iBeacon broadcaster for iOS8 devices.

The app takes either a UUID string, or a friendly string.  If a string is provided, then it is hashed with the same seed
used on [the PassKit Pass Designer](https://create.passkit.com) to produce a UUID that you can use to test Passbook passes generated on
PassKit's platform.
